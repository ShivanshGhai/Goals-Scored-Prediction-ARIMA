# Predicting Football Goals Using Time Series Analysis and ARIMA

## **Objective**

This project leverages historical football match data to forecast the goals scored by the England football team (only for this example, can easily replace it with any other interantional men's football team) in future years. Using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model, we analyze historical trends and patterns to predict performance while accounting for uncertainty.

## **Data**

The dataset includes match details such as:

- **Home Team and Away Team**: Names of teams playing.
- **Scores**: Goals scored by home and away teams.
- **Match Date**: Date when the match occurred.
- **Tournament**: Type of match (e.g., Friendly, Qualifier).
- **Location**: City and country of the match, and whether it was neutral ground.

Focus: Goals scored by England in both home and away matches.

## **Steps Involved**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Converted match dates into a standard format.
   - Ensured scores were numeric for accurate calculations.
   - Extracted years and aggregated yearly goals for England.

2. **Aggregating Goals Scored**
   - Calculated yearly totals for:
     - **Home Goals**
     - **Away Goals**
     - **Total Goals** (sum of home and away).

3. **Time Series Construction**
   - Created a time series object in R using yearly goal totals for analysis and forecasting.

4. **Stationarity Check**
   - Performed a Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to verify stationarity.
   - Applied differencing to stabilize trends and make the data suitable for ARIMA.

5. **ARIMA Modeling**
   - Used the `auto.arima()` function in R to select the best ARIMA configuration.
   - Model components:
     - **AR**: How past values influence current ones.
     - **I**: Addressed trends by differencing.
     - **MA**: Incorporated past prediction errors.

6. **Model Evaluation and Diagnostics**
   - Checked residuals to confirm the model captured significant patterns:
     - ACF and PACF plots of residuals verified no autocorrelation.
     - Histogram of residuals ensured normality.
   - Forecasted goals for future years with confidence intervals.

7. **Results and Interpretation**
   - Forecasts showed stable performance but significant uncertainty due to data variability.
   - Wide confidence intervals highlighted potential fluctuations in predictions.

8. **Limitations and Future Work**
   - **Data Limitations**: Excluded external factors like player injuries or team dynamics.
   - **Model Improvements**: ARIMA assumes linear relationships. Machine learning models may capture more complex patterns.
   - **Broader Analysis**: Extending to other teams could provide comparative insights.

## **Key Results**

- The ARIMA model predicted consistent performance for England's goals, with notable variability.
- Residual diagnostics confirmed a good model fit, with no significant patterns remaining.
- Confidence intervals indicated uncertainty, underscoring the modelâ€™s limitations with the available data.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrated the power of time series analysis in sports analytics, using historical data to forecast England's football performance. While the ARIMA model provided valuable insights, incorporating additional factors and exploring advanced modeling techniques could enhance prediction accuracy in future studies.
